#based on following write-edid script:
#
# Created by Dr. Ace Jeangle (support@chalk-elec.com) 
# based on script from Tom Kazimiers (https://github.com/tomka/write-edid)
#
# Writes EDID information over a given I2C-Bus to a monitor.
# The scripts expects root permissions.
#
# You can find out the bus number with ic2detect -l. Address 0x50
# should be available as the EDID data goes there.



#usage:
# rw-i2c -r -b bus [-c chip_address] [-l size] -f filename
# rw-i2c -w -b bus [-c chip_address] -s start_addr [-l size] [-f filename]
# default chip address is 0x50

#exit codes:
# 1: Input file does not exist or can't be found
# 2: Input file can be found but can not be read
# 3: Argument parsing error
# 4: Multiple files specified
# 5: Neither R not W option is applied
# 6: BOTH R and W options are applied
# 7: For read mode: no file to write the dump to was specified
# 8: No Bus was specified

#42: Size parameter is not yet implemented. Sorry.
